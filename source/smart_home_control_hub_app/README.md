## Software requirement
* This folder does not include Pico toolchain. For information on downloading, installing, and using the toolchain, please visit https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows. This folder used toolchain version is **1.5.1**.
* cmake
* Visual Studio
* GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for windows

## Build instruction
1. Launch the *Developer Command Prompt for VS* in Visual Studio
```sh
set PICO_SDK_PATH=[path to pico-sdk]
set PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=[path to GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\10 2020-q4-major\bin]
cd smart_home_control_hub_app
mkdir build
cd build
[path to cmake] -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
nmake
```
2. SmartHomeControlHub.uf file will be generated in **build** folder

## Program
1. While holding the **BOOTSEL** button, connect the board to computer via the USB cable, or alternatively, press the **RESET** button while holding the **BOOTSEL** button, then release the **RESET** button.
2. Release the **BOOTSEL** button. the board will enter bootloader mode and appear as a removable storage device (RPI-RP2) on computer.
3. Simply drag and drop the generated .uf2 firmware file onto the RPI-RP2 storage device.
